# Mammography-Reports-Based-Breast-Cancer-Detection
This repository contains a ML (Random Forest and XGBoost) and deep learning-based breast cancer detection system leveraging EfficientNet for mammogram classification. The project utilizes the CBIS-DDSM dataset, which includes digitized mammograms labeled with pathology-confirmed diagnoses and BI-RADS assessments.
